## Asciify

This is a program for generating ascii art in the terminal. Not only does this generate ascii art for an image, but it also supports live video from a webcam. This program is written in C++ and uses the OpenCV library for image processing and ncurses for terminal graphics.

Some cool features of this program include:
- Ability to generate ascii art from an image of various types (jpg, png, etc.)
- Live ascii art from a webcam
- Option for colored ascii art
- Resolution control through auto resizing based on terminal size
